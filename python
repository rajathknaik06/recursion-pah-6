""" Neha is developing a text-processing tool and needs assistance with counting the occurrences of a specific character in a given string. She plans to implement a recursive function that iterates through the string character by character, checking if each character matches the specified one.



Your task is to assist Neha in implementing this recursive function.

Input format :
The first line contains the string (S) on which the occurrences are to be counted.

The second line contains a single character (C) to count occurrences.

Output format :
The output prints the integer, representing the number of occurrences of the specified character in the given string.

    if index >= len(s):
        return 0
    # If the character at the current index matches the given character, increment count
    count = 1 if s[index] == char else 0
    # Recur for the rest of the string
    return count + count_occurrences_recursive(s, char, index + 1)
